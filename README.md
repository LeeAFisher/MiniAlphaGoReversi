# MiniAlphaGoReversi
I built the AI as part of a class project. My professor, Dr. Long Chen at UCI wrote the code which simulates gameplay of reversi.
The AI was able to defeat a human who was moderately decent at Reversi, but I do not know anyone who is really good at Reversi to test it against.
The other AI's in our class played together in a tournament, mine was maybe 4th place. I implemented Reinforcement Learning, but it takes a very long time
and a lot of computer power to get see a good improvement. My computer is not that good so I wasn't able to create a very strong AI.
